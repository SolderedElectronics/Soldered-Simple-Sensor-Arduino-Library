 *              Also, see how to calibrate it!
 * 
 *              To successfully run the sketch:
 *              -Connect the breakout to your Dasduino board according to the diagrams below
 *              -Open Serial monitor at 115200 baud!

/**
 * How it works:
 * 
 * This sensor works on the principle that the IR LED will react to IR rays produced by a fire.
 * The response of the IR LED will be reflected in a percentage.
 * 
 * You can use the function getValue() to get that percentage.
 * 
 * 0.00% represents no IR light affecting the sensor, so no fire.
 * 100.00% reporesents a strong IR light affecting the sensor, so there's a fire.
 * 
 * You may also use isFireDetected to get a simple digital reading - is there a fire or not?
 * The threshold of this reading is adjusted by the small potentiometer on the board.
 * 
 * The LED on the board will turn off if the threshold is reached.

    // What this does is essentially make the range of measurement smaller so the data you get is more relevant.
