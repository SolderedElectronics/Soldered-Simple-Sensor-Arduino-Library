 *              Also, see how to calibrate it!
 * 
 *              To successfully run the sketch:
 *              -Connect the breakout to your Dasduino board according to the diagrams below
 *              -Open Serial monitor at 115200 baud!

/**
 * How it works:
 * 
 * This sensor works on the principle that humidity will short electrical
 * contacts on the board of the Fire sensor, thus, lowering the resistance.
 * Through this, a percentage can be calculated which indicates moistness of the soil.
 * 
 * You can use the function getValue() to get that percentage.
 * 
 * 0.00% represents no shorted contacts, so, no rain at all.
 * 100.0% represents fully shorted contacts - the board is fully wet, so, rain is detected.
 * 
 * You may also use isRaining to get a simple digital reading - is it raining or not?
 * The threshold of this reading is adjusted by the small potentiometer on the board.
 * 
 * The LED on the board will turn off if the threshold is reached.

    // What this does is essentially make the range of measurement smaller so the data you get is more relevant.
