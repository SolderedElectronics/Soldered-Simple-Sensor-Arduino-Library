 *              Also, see how to calibrate it!
 * 
 *              To successfully run the sketch:
 *              -Connect the breakout to your Dasduino board according to the diagrams below
 *              -Open Serial monitor at 115200 baud!

/**
 * How it works:
 * 
 * This sensor works on the principle that light will lower the resistance
 * of the light-sensitive resistor connected to the Light Sensor board.
 * Through this, a percentage can be calculated which indicates presence of light.
 * 
 * You can use the function getValue() to get that percentage.
 * 
 * 0.00% represents darkness.
 * 100.0% represents a bright light near the sensor.
 * 
 * You may also use isLightDetected to get a simple digital reading - is light detected or not?
 * The threshold of this reading is adjusted by the small potentiometer on the board.
 * 
 * The LED on the board will turn off if the threshold is reached.

    // Sensor calibration isn't needed but it helps with getting more relevant readings.
    // To calibrate the sensor, first run this sketch with the line of code below commented:
    //lightSensor.calibrate(76.4);

    // Place the sensor so it's as bright as you're ever going to want to measure.
    // This can be under the bright sun or under a small LED light, for example, it's up to you!
    // Note the reading of the light percentage, and then write that value in the calibrate function.
    // What this does is essentially make the range of measurement smaller so the data you get is more relevant.
}

    // Print the readings to Serial
